# hangman
A simple console based hangman game.

There is a master list text files that contains a list of animals and birds. The program takes in this file as an input and then randomly chooses one word which the user has to guess.

The game finishes when the user has tried 7 wrong choices for the word or if the user guesses the right word before running out of chances.

Once started, this game runs endlessly asking the user if he/she wants to play another round. When the user decides not to play anymore, a total score of the user is printed.
